# Find Cafes, Libraries, Parks for Group Meetups — Central Venues

Different groups need different venues. Whether you're studying, socializing, or enjoying the outdoors, midpoint.place helps you find cafes, libraries, and parks at the perfect midpoint for your entire group.

## Why venue type matters

The right venue can make or break a meetup:
- **Cafes**: Great for casual catch-ups, work sessions, small group discussions
- **Libraries**: Perfect for quiet study groups, book clubs, focused work
- **Parks**: Ideal for outdoor activities, large groups, active meetups, dog-friendly gatherings

## How to find your perfect venue

1. **Calculate your group's midpoint** from all members' locations
2. **Filter by venue type**: Cafes, libraries, parks, or all of them
3. **Refine with amenities**: Wi-Fi, parking, accessibility, hours
4. **Compare options**: Distance, ratings, photos, reviews
5. **Share and vote**: Let the group decide democratically

### Activity-based selection
Match venue to activity:

**Social Club**: 8 friends rotate between a central park for summer BBQs and a cozy cafe for winter gatherings, both at the same midpoint.

**Dog Owners**: 6 pet parents found a dog park that's equidistant from everyone's home. Weekly Saturday morning meetups for dogs and coffee.

**Freelance Collective**: 10 freelancers rotate between 3 cafes at their midpoint, supporting local businesses and getting variety.

## FAQs

**How do I know if a venue welcomes groups?**  
Check reviews for mentions of groups, or call ahead. Many cafes and libraries explicitly state group policies.

**Can I save favorite venues?**  
Yes—build a rotation of 3-5 venues at your midpoint for variety.

**What if there are no good options at our exact midpoint?**  
Expand your search radius slightly—a few extra minutes of travel is worth finding the right venue.

**Are park meetups safe at night?**  
Check park hours and lighting. Most parks close at dusk. For evening meetups, stick to well-lit areas or choose indoor venues.

**Can I mix venue types?**  
Absolutely! Start at a cafe for coffee, then walk to a nearby park for outdoor activities.

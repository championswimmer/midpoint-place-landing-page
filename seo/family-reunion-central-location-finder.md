# Family Reunion Central Location Finder — Fair for Everyone

Family spread across the state or country? organizing a reunion starts with finding a fair location. midpoint.place calculates the geographic center of all your relatives' homes to suggest the best town or venue for your gathering.

## Great for

- Annual family picnics
- Holiday gatherings
- Cousins' meetups

## How to plan

1. Input the cities or addresses of all family branches.
2. Identify the central town or area.
3. Search for large venues, parks, or hotels nearby.

## Example

Three siblings living in three different cities find a central state park with picnic facilities that is a 2-hour drive for each family unit.

## FAQs

**How many locations can I add?**  
You can add multiple addresses to represent all your family members.

You can use travel-time weighting to ensure the drive time is fair, not just the physical distance.

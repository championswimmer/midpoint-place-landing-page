# Family Reunion Central Location Finder — Fair for Everyone

Family spread across the state or country? Organizing a reunion is tough enough without the arguments about "who has to drive the furthest." midpoint.place calculates the geographic center of all your relatives' homes to suggest the best town or venue for your gathering, ensuring the journey is fair for the whole family tree.

## The politics of reunion planning

Historically, reunions defaulted to "Grandma's house" or the hometown. But as families disperse, that old hub might be a flight for some and a walk for others.
- **Fairness**: A central location reduces the burden on those who moved furthest away.
- **Neutrality**: No single branch of the family has to host, clean, and cook.
- **Adventure**: It turns the reunion into a mini-vacation in a new place.

## Finding the right venue type

Once you find the midpoint town, look for venues that fit your headcount:

### 1. State Parks & Pavilions
**Best For**: Casual, low-cost summer gatherings.
**Amenities**: Grills, playgrounds for the kids, bathrooms, hiking trails.
**Tip**: Book the pavilion months in advance.

### 2. Banquet Halls / Hotels
**Best For**: Milestone anniversaries or winter reunions.
**Amenities**: Catering, climate control, and rooms for out-of-towners in the same building.

### 3. Large Vacation Rentals (Airbnbs/VRBOs)
**Best For**: Smaller families (10-20 people) doing a weekend retreat.
**Amenities**: Full kitchen, living rooms for hanging out, private bedrooms.

## Considerations for multi-generational travel

- **The Elders**: Avoid rugged terrain. Ensure ADA accessibility and comfortable seating.
- **The Kids**: Need entertainment. A park with a pool or playground is a lifesaver.
- **The Drivers**: If the midpoint is 3+ hours away, ensure there are affordable hotels nearby for those who don't want to drive back same-day.

## Step-by-step planning guide

1. **Collect Locations**: Get the zip codes of every household.
2. **Find the Hub**: Use midpoint.place to identify the central city or region.
3. **Scout Venues**: Search Google Maps near the midpoint for "Event Venue" or "Park".
4. **Poll the Family**: Send 2-3 options at the midpoint. "Option A is a park, Option B is a restaurant."
5. **Book It**: secure the date and send invitations.

## Example Scenario

The Smith family is split between Chicago, St. Louis, and Indianapolis.
- **Midpoint**: Champaign, IL.
- **The Plan**: They rent a large pavilion at a park in Champaign. Everyone drives ~2 hours. They have a potluck lunch, play softball, and head home by sunset. It's an easy day trip for everyone.

## FAQs

**How many locations can I add?**  
You can add as many addresses as you need to represent every aunt, uncle, and cousin.

**Does it consider traffic?**  
Yes, switch to "Travel Time" mode to see who has the longest drive and adjust accordingly.

**What if the midpoint is in the middle of nowhere?**  
The algorithm will show you the exact center, but you can zoom out to find the nearest town with amenities. It's often better to drive an extra 15 minutes to a nice town than meet in a cornfield.

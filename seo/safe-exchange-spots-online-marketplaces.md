# Safe Exchange Spots for Online Marketplaces — Neutral & Fair

You found the perfect deal on Facebook Marketplace, but the seller lives 40 minutes away and "porch pickup" feels risky. Or maybe you're selling a laptop and don't want a stranger knowing where you sleep. midpoint.place helps you find a safe, public, and equidistant location to meet buyers or sellers, ensuring the transaction is secure and the travel is fair.

## The rules of the safe trade

Safety should never be compromised for a deal.
- **Rule #1**: Never meet at a private residence for high-value items.
- **Rule #2**: Never get into a stranger's car.
- **Rule #3**: Always meet in daylight.

## Best venues for exchanges

When you calculate the midpoint, look for these specific venue types:

### 1. Police Station "Safe Zones"
Many police departments have designated "E-Commerce Exchange Zones" in their lobbies or parking lots. These are monitored by cameras 24/7.
- **Search**: "Police Station" or "Sheriff's Office".

### 2. Bank Lobbies
If you are selling a car or item for cash, meeting at a bank is smart.
- **Benefit**: You can verify the cash is real/deposit it immediately.
- **Benefit**: Cameras are everywhere.

### 3. Busy Coffee Shops
For lower stakes items (clothes, books), a Starbucks is perfect.
- **Benefit**: Wi-Fi allows you to Venmo/Zelle instantly.
- **Benefit**: High foot traffic discourages bad behavior.

## Handling the "Fairness" of travel

- **The Standard**: Splitting the drive 50/50 is the polite norm for mid-value items ($50+).
- **The Exception**: For cheap items (under $20), the buyer usually travels to the seller.
- **The Negotiation**: Use the midpoint.place map to show *why* a specific spot is fair. "Hey, this mall is exactly 15 mins for both of us."

## Tips for specific items

- **Electronics**: Meet somewhere with power outlets (cafe) to test that it turns on.
- **Clothing**: Do not try things on in a stranger's car. Meet at a mall with public restrooms if needed.
- **Furniture**: If the item is huge, you might *have* to go to their house. Bring a friend. Do not go alone.

## FAQs

**Can I share the location without sharing my address?**  
Yes! That's the whole point. You enter your general area (zip code), finding the midpoint without ever revealing your street address.

**What if they refuse to meet halfway?**  
If a buyer refuses to meet in a public place, that is a red flag. Walk away from the deal.

**Is it safe to use Venmo/CashApp?**  
Yes, but treat it like cash. Once sent, it's gone. Verify the item *before* sending payment.

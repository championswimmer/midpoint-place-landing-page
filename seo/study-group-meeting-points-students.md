# Study Group Meeting Points — Central Libraries & Cafes

Group projects are hard enough without the argument over *where* to meet. When your team is split between dorms, off-campus apartments, and commuter homes, finding a fair spot is crucial. midpoint.place helps students find a central library, cafe, or study hall that is accessible to all, saving precious semester hours for actual studying.

## The hierarchy of study spots

Not all tables are created equal. Use the midpoint to find the right environment:

### 1. The University Library (Neutral Ground)
If everyone attends the same school but lives far apart, the campus library is the default.
- **But**: Which one? Large campuses have 10+ libraries. Use the tool to find the one central to everyone's dorms.

### 2. The "Third Wave" Coffee Shop
**Best For**: Brainstorming and casual review.
**Needs**:
- **Big Tables**: You need to fit 4 laptops.
- **Power**: A cafe without outlets is useless.
- **Caffeine**: Obviously.

### 3. The Public Library (The Secret Weapon)
**Best For**: Serious, quiet work.
**Why**: Unlike campus libraries which get crowded during finals, local public library branches are often quiet hidden gems.
**Bonus**: They often have bookable "Study Rooms" for free.

## Considerations for commuter students

If you have members who drive in:
- **Parking**: Don't meet at a downtown cafe with no parking. Find a spot with a lot.
- **Safety**: If meeting late at night, choose a well-lit campus building or 24-hour diner.

## The "Late Night" Cram Session

When the library closes at midnight but the paper is due at 8 AM:
- **Search**: "24 Hour Diner" or "Late Night Cafe".
- **Midpoint**: Crucial so no one falls asleep at the wheel driving 45 mins home at 3 AM.

## Example Scenario

A Biology group has 4 members: 2 in Dorms, 2 Commuters living North and South.
- **The Problem**: Meeting at the dorms is unfair to commuters (parking fees). Meeting at commuters' houses is too far for dorm students (no cars).
- **The Solution**: midpoint.place finds a Panera Bread with free Wi-Fi just off campus, near the commuter lot.
- **The Result**: Neutral ground, easy parking, and infinite coffee refills.

## FAQs

**Can we find places with whiteboards?**  
Search for "Coworking Space" or "Library Study Room". Many public libraries have whiteboard rooms you can reserve.

**Does it work for high school groups?**  
Yes! Parents love it because they can drive their teens to a safe, central library rather than a stranger's house.

**What if we need to talk loud?**  
Avoid the "Quiet Floor" of the library. Pick a cafe or a student union building.

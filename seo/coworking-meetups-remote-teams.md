# Coworking Meetups for Remote Teams — Central Workspaces

Remote work is great, but sometimes you need face time. midpoint.place helps distributed teams find a central coworking space or meeting room for quarterly planning, sprints, or team bonding.

## Use Cases

- Sprint planning sessions
- Team lunches
- Co-working days

## How it works

1. Enter the home office locations of your team.
2. Find the central city or district.
3. Locate "Day Pass" coworking spaces nearby.

## Example

A startup team distributed across the Bay Area meets at a coworking space in San Mateo, minimizing the commute for SF, East Bay, and South Bay employees.

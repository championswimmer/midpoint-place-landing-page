## FAQs

**How accurate is the midpoint?**  
We calculate an equidistant point using geospatial methods. For practical meetups, we pair that midpoint with nearby, well-rated venues.

**Do I need exact addresses?**  
You can enter landmarks or drag map pins—whatever’s easiest.

**What if we prefer to minimize driving time, not distance?**  
Use our travel-time approach (see the Weighted Midpoint page) to account for traffic and mode of travel.

# Halfway Point Between Two Addresses — Meet Fairly in the Middle

Finding a fair place to meet between two addresses shouldn’t be a hassle. Whether you’re planning a casual coffee, a client meeting, or a safe Craigslist exchange, midpoint.place calculates the exact midpoint between any two locations and suggests great venues nearby so nobody travels unfairly far.

## The problem with "I'll come to you"

Politeness often dictates that one person travels to the other. But over time, this creates an imbalance.
- **The "Host" Fatigue**: The person who stays local has to clean/prep or just feels guilty.
- **The "Traveler" Burnout**: The person driving feels their time is valued less.
- **The Solution**: A neutral halfway point resets the dynamic to 50/50.

## How to find the perfect halfway point

### 1. Input the Starts
Enter the two addresses. They can be specific (123 Main St) or general (Zip Code 90210).
### 2. Analyze the Center
The tool places a pin at the geographic center.
- *Tip*: If the center is in a lake or a highway interchange, zoom out slightly to find the nearest commercial zone.
### 3. Select the Venue
Don't just say "Meet at the gas station." Look for:
- **Coffee Shops**: For low-stakes chats.
- **Diners**: For meals.
- **Malls**: For safe, public exchanges.

## Common Scenarios

### The Online Marketplace Swap
Selling a guitar on Facebook Marketplace? Don't have a stranger come to your house.
- **Strategy**: Find the halfway point between you and the buyer.
- **Venue**: A busy gas station or police station parking lot.

### The First Date
Meeting someone from a dating app who lives in a different borough?
- **Strategy**: Find a bar or cafe in the middle.
- **Benefit**: If the date goes poorly, you both have an equal commute home.

### The Long-Distance Friend
You live in City A, they live in City B (2 hours apart).
- **Strategy**: Find the town at the 1-hour mark.
- **Benefit**: It turns a "slog" into a manageable day trip.

## Technical details: Distance vs. Time

- **Geographic Midpoint**: The physical center "as the crow flies." Good for general fairness.
- **Travel Time Midpoint**: The point where drive times are equal. (e.g., if one person is driving on a fast highway and the other on slow city streets, the point moves closer to the city driver). *midpoint.place supports both perspectives.*

## FAQs

**Do I need exact addresses?**  
No. You can use landmarks ("Eiffel Tower") or drag pins on the map.

**What if the halfway point is unsafe?**  
Always check the street view or use well-known venues (like Starbucks or McDonald's) which tend to be in trafficked areas.

**Can I share the map?**  
Yes, sending the link proves to the other person that you picked a spot that is mathematically fair.

# Meetups Not Far From Anyone — Fair Distance for All

Planning group meetups shouldn't mean someone has to travel twice as far as everyone else. midpoint.place calculates the optimal midpoint that keeps travel distance fair for every member of your group.

## Why distance fairness matters

- No one feels like they're always the one traveling far
- Higher attendance when meetups are convenient for everyone
- Builds group cohesion and satisfaction
- Saves time and reduces travel fatigue

## How midpoint.place keeps it fair

1. Add all group members' locations (home, work, or any starting point)
2. Our algorithm calculates a balanced midpoint considering everyone
3. View distance and travel time for each member
4. Browse nearby venues so you can meet without anyone traveling too far
5. Vote on the final spot as a group

## Perfect for

- Friend groups spread across different neighborhoods
- Colleagues working from various offices or remote locations
- Book clubs, running clubs, or hobby groups
- Family gatherings with members from different areas
- Study groups with students from different parts of town

## Smart features

- **Distance visualization**: See how far each person needs to travel
- **Travel time balancing**: Factor in actual commute times, not just distance
- **Multiple starting points**: Members can set home, work, or custom locations
- **Venue suggestions**: Find cafes, parks, restaurants that work for everyone

## Real scenarios

- A 6-person book club finds a library that's 15-20 minutes from everyone instead of 45 minutes for some
- Friends from north, south, east, and west parts of the city meet at a central cafe where no one travels more than 25 minutes
- A running club identifies a park that's equidistant from all members' homes

## FAQs

**How do you ensure fairness?**  
We calculate the geometric midpoint and optimize for minimal maximum distance, meaning we try to reduce the longest journey anyone has to make.

**Can I weight certain members differently?**  
Yes—you can prioritize members with mobility challenges or those without cars to find more accessible spots.

**What if the midpoint is in an inconvenient area?**  
Browse nearby venues within a small radius to find a better spot that's still fair for everyone.

**Does it work for large groups?**  
Absolutely—whether you have 3 people or 30, we'll find a fair middle ground.

# Client Meeting Locations — Professional & Convenient

In sales, the small details matter. Asking a prospect to drive an hour to your office can be a big ask for a first meeting. Conversely, driving an hour to them puts you at a disadvantage if you arrive frazzled. midpoint.place helps you find a professional venue halfway between your office and theirs, signaling respect and partnership from the very first interaction.

## The psychology of the "Halfway" meeting

Meeting halfway is a powerful non-verbal cue. It says:
- **"We are partners"**: We share the effort.
- **"I value your time"**: I'm not asking you to commute for me.
- **"Neutral Ground"**: We are stepping away from "my turf" or "your turf" to have an open conversation.

## Choosing the right venue for the deal

The venue sets the tone. A noisy Starbucks might be fine for a quick catch-up, but not for closing a six-figure deal.

### 1. The "Intro" Coffee
**Goal**: Low pressure, relationship building.
**Venue**: Upscale coffee shop or hotel lobby.
**Needs**: Comfortable seating, not too loud, good coffee.

### 2. The "Pitch" Lunch
**Goal**: Presentation and persuasion.
**Venue**: Quiet restaurant with large tables.
**Needs**: Ability to hear clearly, table space for a tablet/laptop, attentive but not intrusive service.

### 3. The "Closing" Dinner
**Goal**: Celebration and signing.
**Venue**: Steakhouse or high-end bistro.
**Needs**: Privacy, excellent service, celebratory atmosphere.

## Amenities checklist for sales reps

Before you send the invite, check the venue for:
- **Wi-Fi Strength**: Can you run your cloud demo?
- **Power**: Is there an outlet if the meeting runs long?
- **Parking**: Will your client struggle to park? (If so, validate their ticket).
- **Table Size**: Can you fit two laptops and notebooks?

## Best practices

1. **Arrive Early**: Get there 15 minutes before the client. Secure the best table (corner, quiet, power access).
2. **Pre-Check the Menu**: Know what to recommend.
3. **Pay the Bill**: If you invited them, you pay. No awkward pauses.
4. **Send the Map**: When proposing the meeting, send the midpoint.place link. "I found this spot that's exactly 15 mins for both of us" is a great opener.

## Example Scenario

A software sales rep in Downtown needs to meet a Manufacturing CEO in the Industrial Park (40 miles away).
- **Option A**: Drive to the CEO. Rep is stuck in traffic, late, and stressed.
- **Option B**: Meet at a nice hotel lounge at Exit 20 (Midpoint). Both drive 20 mins. The meeting starts on time, both are relaxed, and the neutral ground fosters open dialogue.

## FAQs

**What if the client insists on their office?**  
Always defer to the client's preference. But offering a midpoint shows you are considerate, even if they decline.

**Can I find places near highways?**  
Yes, the map view makes it easy to spot venues near highway exits for quick access.

**Is this good for recruiting?**  
Absolutely. Meeting candidates halfway reduces the friction of the interview process.

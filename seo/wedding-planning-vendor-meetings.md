# Wedding Planning Vendor Meetings — Meet Halfway

Planning a wedding is a full-time job on top of your full-time job. Between cake tastings, floral consultations, and photographer interviews, you can spend hours in the car. midpoint.place helps couples meet their vendors at convenient central locations, saving time and keeping the "Wedding Fatigue" at bay.

## Why meet halfway?

- **Vendor Geography**: Your dream photographer might live 2 hours away. Asking them to come to you might incur a "travel fee." Meeting halfway avoids this.
- **Neutral Ground**: Many vendors work from home studios. Meeting in public is safer and more professional for the first consultation.
- **Efficiency**: You can schedule back-to-back meetings at a central hub.

## Choosing the right meeting spot

Different vendors require different settings:

### 1. The Planner / Coordinator
**Needs**: Large tables.
**Why**: You will be looking at timelines, floor plans, and spreadsheets. A tiny bistro table won't cut it.
**Venue**: Panera Bread, Hotel Lobbies, or Coworking Spaces.

### 2. The Photographer / Videographer
**Needs**: Good lighting.
**Why**: They will be showing you physical albums or portfolios on tablets. Glare is the enemy.
**Venue**: Bright, airy coffee shops.

### 3. The Florist
**Needs**: Visual inspiration.
**Venue**: Sometimes they need to meet *at the venue* to visualize the space. If not, pick a place with Wi-Fi to browse Pinterest boards.

## When NOT to meet halfway

- **Cake Tasting**: You must go to the bakery.
- **Dress Fitting**: You must go to the salon.
- **Venue Tour**: Obviously, you go to the venue.
- **Strategy**: Use midpoint.place to find a lunch spot *between* these fixed appointments if you are doing a marathon day.

## Example Scenario

Couple lives in the City. Wedding is in the Countryside. Florist lives in a neighboring Town.
- **The Challenge**: Where to review the floral proposal?
- **The Solution**: midpoint.place finds a cute cafe at the highway junction central to all three.
- **The Result**: Couple drives 30 mins (instead of 60). Florist drives 20 mins. They sign the contract over cappuccinos.

## FAQs

**Is it rude to ask a vendor to travel?**  
No, but offering to meet halfway is a gesture of goodwill that starts the relationship off right.

**Can we meet at the venue?**  
Only if you have an appointment. Venues often have other events going on.

**How do we handle multiple parents?**  
If the in-laws want to join the meeting, add their address to the midpoint calculation to find a spot fair for the whole family.

# Find Common Ground — No One Travels Too Far

Finding common ground isn't just about compromise—it's about fairness. With midpoint.place, you can easily identify locations where everyone in your group travels a reasonable distance, making meetups more frequent and enjoyable.

## The common ground advantage

When you find true common ground:
- Everyone feels their time and effort are valued
- Meetups happen more often because they're convenient
- Group dynamics improve when no one is consistently disadvantaged
- Decision-making becomes faster and less contentious

## How we find your common ground

1. **Map your group**: Add locations for all members
2. **Calculate the center**: Our algorithm finds the optimal midpoint
3. **Check fairness**: See travel distance and time for each person
4. **Discover venues**: Browse cafes, restaurants, parks, and more nearby
5. **Decide together**: Share options and vote as a group

## Ideal for these groups

### Social groups
- Friends living in different parts of the city
- Alumni groups reconnecting from various locations
- Hobby enthusiasts spread across regions

### Professional groups
- Remote teams meeting in person
- Cross-office collaborations
- Networking groups from different companies

### Activity groups
- Sports teams and practice squads
- Fitness groups and running clubs
- Creative workshops and art circles

## Smart balancing features

- **Equal travel time**: Factor in traffic and public transport
- **Accessibility options**: Prioritize transit-accessible locations
- **Custom constraints**: Set maximum travel distance limits
- **Multiple scenarios**: Compare different potential meeting areas

## Success stories

**Photography Club**: 12 members from across the metro area now meet at a park that's 20-25 minutes from everyone instead of the old spot that was 10 minutes for some and 50+ for others.

**Startup Founders Network**: Regular meetups at a coworking space equidistant from 3 different business districts increased attendance by 40%.

**Family Reunion Planning**: Extended family from 5 different suburbs found a restaurant where everyone drives less than 30 minutes.

## Tips for finding the best common ground

1. **Consider different times**: Rush hour vs. off-peak affects fairness
2. **Multiple origins**: Some members might want to meet from work, others from home
3. **Venue amenities**: Make sure the common ground has what your group needs
4. **Backup options**: Have 2-3 locations ready in case your first choice is full

## FAQs

**What if my group is spread very far apart?**  
We'll still find the optimal midpoint and show you the distance reality. You can then decide if a virtual meeting makes more sense or if a central location is worth it.

**Can I exclude certain areas?**  
Yes—you can set preferences to avoid specific neighborhoods or find venues with parking, transit access, etc.

**How accurate is the travel time calculation?**  
We use real-world data to estimate travel times, but actual times may vary based on traffic, transit schedules, and your specific route.

**Does this work internationally?**  
Yes! midpoint.place works anywhere in the world with map data.

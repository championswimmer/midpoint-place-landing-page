# Group Meetup Location Finder — Pick a Place That’s Fair

Planning a group meetup often feels like herding cats. Between finding a date that works and a location that doesn't alienate anyone, it's a recipe for "Let's just circle back next week" (and never meeting). midpoint.place cuts through the noise by mathematically calculating the fairest spot for everyone, transforming the "Where should we meet?" debate into a solved problem.

## The "Herding Cats" problem

We've all been there:
- **The "Downtown" Bias**: Suggesting the city center because it's "easy," even though 80% of the group lives in the suburbs.
- **The "Host" Burden**: One person always offers their house, but eventually gets tired of cleaning up.
- **The "Cancel" Cascade**: When the location is annoying to get to, people flake last minute.

## How to use a location finder effectively

### 1. Collect the Data (Privately)
You don't need everyone's exact home address. Cross streets or zip codes work fine for privacy. midpoint.place processes these to find the center of gravity.

### 2. Determine the Vibe
Once you have the geographic center, look at the map.
- **Is it a downtown core?** Great for nightlife and dining.
- **Is it a suburban hub?** Look for malls or large parks.
- **Is it "in the middle of nowhere"?** Zoom out to the nearest town. It's better to drive 5 extra minutes to a good venue than meet at a highway gas station.

### 3. Shortlist and Share
Don't just send one option. Send three:
- **The "Casual" Option**: A coffee shop or park.
- **The "Foodie" Option**: A well-rated restaurant.
- **The "Activity" Option**: Bowling, axe throwing, or arcade.

## Venue strategies for group sizes

- **Small (3-5 people)**: Cafe tables or bar booths. No reservation needed usually.
- **Medium (6-12 people)**: Restaurants with "family style" dining or outdoor beer gardens. Reservations recommended.
- **Large (12+ people)**: Parks, rented pavilions, or private rooms in pubs.

## Handling the "New Person"
Groups change. If a new friend joins who lives 30 miles south, the old meetup spot is no longer fair.
- **Recalculate**: It takes seconds to add a new pin and see how the midpoint shifts.
- **Rotate**: If the new midpoint sucks, alternate between the old spot and a new spot closer to the new person.

## FAQs

**What if the midpoint is in the water?**  
(Common in coastal cities). The tool identifies the nearest land-based venues to the mathematical center.

**Can we vote on the options?**  
Yes, sharing the results link allows everyone to see the logic and voice their preference.

**Does this work for international groups?**  
Yes, though for very large distances (e.g., London vs New York), the "midpoint" might be in the ocean. In that case, it helps identify a central "hub city" for a destination retreat.

## Stop debating, start meeting

Remove the friction from your social life. Use midpoint.place to find the fair, central location that makes everyone say "I'll be there."

# Democratically Selected Meetup Points — Fair Group Decisions

Democracy shouldn't stop at elections—it should extend to your group meetups too. midpoint.place enables truly democratic selection of meeting spots through fair midpoint calculation and group voting features.

## Why democratic selection matters

- **Equal voice**: Everyone gets to participate in the decision
- **Higher satisfaction**: People are happier with locations they helped choose
- **Better attendance**: Democratic choices lead to better buy-in
- **Faster decisions**: Structured voting beats endless group chat debates
- **Fair from the start**: The midpoint ensures geographic fairness before voting even begins

## How democratic meetup selection works

### Step 1: Fair foundation
Start with geographic fairness by calculating the midpoint between all group members' locations.

### Step 2: Discover options
Browse nearby venues within the fair zone:
- Cafes and coffee shops
- Restaurants and bars
- Parks and outdoor spaces
- Libraries and coworking spaces
- Activity venues

### Step 3: Democratic voting
Share the shortlist with your group and let everyone vote:
- Rank preferences
- Veto deal-breakers
- Add comments and reasons
- See results in real-time

### Step 4: Decide together
The group's collective choice becomes your meetup spot—fair, democratic, and agreed upon by all.

## Perfect for democratic groups

- Book clubs choosing next month's location

### Professional groups

## Democratic features

- **Anonymous voting**: Optional privacy for honest feedback
- **Weighted preferences**: Rank your top 3 choices
- **Veto options**: Flag locations that absolutely don't work
- **Comment threads**: Discuss pros and cons of each venue
- **Results transparency**: See how the group voted
- **Re-voting**: Easy to run another round if needed

## Beyond simple majority

Our democratic system considers:
- Geographic fairness (the midpoint)
- Individual preferences (voting)
- Accessibility requirements
- Budget constraints
- Venue amenities

This ensures the winner isn't just popular, but actually works for everyone.

## Real-world examples

**Tech Meetup Group**: 50 members vote on quarterly meetup locations. Since implementing midpoint.place, attendance increased 35% because venues are both geographically fair and democratically selected.

**Running Club**: Members vote on new trail locations each month. The democratic process increased participation and discovered new running spots nobody knew about.

**Parents Group**: Weekly coffee meetups rotate through democratically selected cafes, ensuring fairness and variety. No more one parent always hosting or picking.

## Best practices for democratic meetup selection

1. **Set clear criteria**: Agree on what matters (price range, parking, noise level, etc.)
2. **Limit options**: Too many choices slow down decisions—shortlist 3-5 venues
3. **Time-box voting**: Set a deadline for votes to keep things moving
4. **Respect results**: Once voted, commit to it (unless there's a genuine emergency)
5. **Gather feedback**: After meetups, collect input to improve future selections

## FAQs

**What if there's a tie?**  
You can either have a runoff vote between the tied options or let the group organizer make the final call.

**Can people vote multiple times?**  
No—each member gets one vote to keep it fair. However, they can rank multiple preferences.

**What if someone can't make any of the options?**  
They can still vote on what works best for the group, or you can add their constraints and find new options.

**How many people need to vote?**  
You can set a minimum quorum (e.g., 50% of members) or a voting deadline.

**Can I see who voted for what?**  
That's up to your group settings—you can make voting public or anonymous.

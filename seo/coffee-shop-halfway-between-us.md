# Coffee Shop Halfway Between Us — Meet for a Fair Coffee

The phrase "Let's grab coffee" is the universal code for connecting. It's low stakes, low cost, and time-flexible. But when you live across town from each other, a 30-minute drive for a 30-minute latte doesn't make sense. midpoint.place finds a midpoint between two (or more) locations and suggests nearby coffee shops so you can agree fast and keep things fair.

## The many types of coffee meetups

Not all coffee dates are created equal. Knowing your goal helps you pick the right midpoint venue.

### 1. The "Work from Anywhere" Duo
**Goal**: Co-working with a friend to stay accountable.
**Needs**: Large tables, reliable Wi-Fi, power outlets, and a policy that allows staying for hours.
**Search**: Look for "roastery" or large independent cafes.

### 2. The First Hinge/Bumble Date
**Goal**: Quick vibe check, safety, easy exit if needed.
**Needs**: Public setting, busy but not loud, walking distance to a park (for a "walk and talk" extension).
**Search**: Look for popular, well-rated spots in busy districts.

### 3. The Deep Catch-Up
**Goal**: Gossiping about everything you missed in the last month.
**Needs**: Comfy armchairs, quiet corners, maybe some pastries.
**Search**: Look for "cozy" or "lounge" in reviews.

## Why meeting halfway works for coffee

- **Low Commitment**: If the meeting is short, the travel should be short too.
- **Fairness**: No one feels resentful about driving 45 minutes for a cappuccino.
- **Discovery**: You get to try new beans and blends in neighborhoods you don't usually frequent.

## Coffee shop etiquette for remote meetups

When meeting at a third-party location:
- **Buy Something**: If you're occupying a table for 2 hours, buy more than one espresso. Get a sandwich or a second drink.
- **Share the Space**: Don't spread your laptop, notebook, and bag across a 4-top table if it's just you.
- **Headphones**: If you need to watch a video or take a call, use them.

## How to use midpoint.place

1. **Enter Locations**: Put in your starting point and your friend's.
2. **Calculate Midpoint**: We find the geographic center.
3. **Filter**: Search for "coffee" or specific chains if you have a preference.
4. **Check the Vibe**: Use the Google Maps link to check photos—do you see laptops? (Good for work) Do you see soft lighting? (Good for dates).

## Example meetups

- **The Freelancers**: Two designers living 10 miles apart meet at a cafe with an outdoor patio exactly 5 miles from each. They work for 3 hours.
- **The Study Group**: Four students from different dorms find a 24-hour cafe central to campus and their apartments during finals week.

## FAQs

**Can I add more than two locations?**  
Absolutely—add the whole study group and we’ll find the center of mass.

**What if one person drives and one walks?**  
You can visually adjust the midpoint closer to the walker, or just agree on a spot that has parking for the driver and is walkable for the other.

**Can we find big chains like Starbucks/Dunkin?**  
Yes, they will appear on the map. They are often reliable choices for "neutral ground".
